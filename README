Authors
=======
dungeonbash is largely the work of one person, Martin Read.

Acknowledgements
================
dungeonbash could not have reached its current state without the benefit of bug
reports and inspirational ideas from a variety of places. As such,
acknowledgements are due to numerous people.

- Michael Toy, Glenn Wichman, and Ken Arnold, for writing the original "rogue".
- Everyone who reported bugs on past versions of the game, including:
- Jon Amery (bug reports)
- Adam White (data size bugs)
- Gero Kunter (bug reports; balance suggestions)
- David Damerell (bug reports)
- Richard Kettlewell (portability advice regarding building on Darwin)
- Jeff Lait (progenitor of the Seven Day Roguelike Challenge; author of
  POWDER, an approximate ripoff of whose speed system still underpins 
  dungeonbash; suggesting the "weapons and armour are consumables"
  approach, which is unusual for roguelikes)
