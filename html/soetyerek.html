<h2>The Island of Söťerek</h2>

<P>The island of Söťerek<sup>[1]</sup> is a strange and magic-afflicted place, somewhere in the vast, unknowable reaches of the outer ocean. Those who have returned from Söťerek tell of many strange and terrible wonders, but most of all they are baffled by the Dungeon.</p>

<p>The Dungeon seems to serve no purpose, except perhaps the amusement of the perverse demon-gods whose followers have made it home, and its architecture defies all reason. Bold explorers of great skill and integrity have made maps of its upper reaches on one expedition, only to find the layout of its passageways changed beyond recognition on the next.</p>

<p>Some bastard has arranged for you to wake up in the Dungeon with only a dagger and a barbaric bifurcated lower garment to your name. You think alcohol may have been involved, but your memory is pretty hazy after bumping into that gorgeous person in a dockside tavern.</p>

<hr>

<p>[1] If you're stuck in ASCII, or an 8-bit encoding that doesn't support Eastern European languages, "Soetyerek" or "Sötyerek" are reasonable alternative spellings. "Söt'erek" is strongly discouraged. The letter after the "ö" isn't supposed to be a "t" followed by an apostrophe, it's supposed to be a "t" with a caron.</p>
