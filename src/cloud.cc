// intended mechanics:
//
//   A cloud affects its victims on the tick they enter it. It then affects
//   them on any *future* normal-speed tick they finish in it.
//
//   All clouds block LOS.
//
//   fog cloud: harmless
//   fire cloud: does 1d4 fire damage.
//   ice cloud: does 1d4 cold damage.
//   abyssal cloud: does 1d10 death damage.
//
// Spawning a fire cloud into an ice cloud (or v.v.) produces a fog cloud.
// Fire and ice clouds overwrite fog. Abyssal clouds overwrite all others and
// cannot be overwritten.
